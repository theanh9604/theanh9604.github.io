I'm a final-year student in Electrical Engineering - Power System in Hanoi University of Science and Technology where I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. Huy Nguyen-Duc. I will graduate in February 2026. I'm looking for opportunities in Graduate Program in Australia and USA. My research focus on Microgrid Operational Optimization, Power System Dynamic Stability, Renewable Energy Sources. 

My Bachelor Thesis is Oscillation source detection in Power System, simulating on ANDES Power System in Python.
